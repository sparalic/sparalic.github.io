      <description>Determine the major mechanotransduction pathway by which blood flow-driven shear stress activates cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and prostaglandin I2 (PGI2) release in endothelial cells. Our work has demonstrated for the first time that COX-2/PGI2 mechanotransduction is mediated by the mechanosensor platelet endothelial cell adhesion mole- cule-1 (PECAM-1).

      <title>Hydraulic Conductivity of Smooth Muscle Cell-Initiated Arterial Cocultures.</title>

      <description>The purpose of the study was to examine the effects of arterial coculture conditions on the transport properties of several in vitro endothelial cell (EC)-smooth muscle cell (SMC)-porous filter constructs in which SMC were grown to confluence first and then EC were inoculated. This order of culturing simulates the environment of a blood vessel wall after endothelial layer damage due to stenting, vascular grafting or other vascular wall insult. For all coculture configurations examined, we observed that hydraulic conductivity (L(p)) values were significantly higher than predicted by a resistances-in-series (RIS) model accounting for the L(p) of EC and SMC measured separately.</description>

      <description>This study describes cocultures of arterial smooth muscle cells (SMCs) and endothelial cells (ECs) and the influences of their heterotypic interactions on hydraulic conductivity (L p ), an important transport property. A unique feature of these cocultures is that ECs were first grown to confluence and then SMCs were inoculated. Bovine aortic smooth muscle cells and bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAECs) were cocultured on Transwell Permeable Supports, and then exposed to a pressure-driven transmural flow.</description>

      <title>Improved agarose gel electrophoresis method and molecular mass calculation for high molecular mass hyaluronan.</title>

      <description>The molecular mass of the polysaccharide hyaluronan (HA) is an important determinant of its biological activity and physicochemical properties. One method currently used for the analysis of the molecular mass distribution of an HA sample is gel electrophoresis. In the current work, an improved agarose gel electrophoresis method for analysis of high molecular mass HA is presented and validated. HA mobility in 0.5% agarose minigels was found to be linearly related to the logarithm of molecular mass in the range from approximately 200 to 6000 kDa.</description>

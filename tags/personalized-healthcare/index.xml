Problem Readmission whether planned or unplanned costs the U.S healthcare system billions of dollars annually. This, among other things, is of great importance to healthcare systems, since about one-third of readmissions are preventable, providing a huge opportunity for hospital systems to improve their quality of care 1. This compounded with the fact that hospitals are also penalized with up to 3% lower reimbursements from the Centers for Medicare &amp;amp; Medicaid Services(CMS) for increased readmission rates, as a part of the 2012 affordable care act passed by the Obama administration 2, creates a huge opportunity for the use of data to build algorithms that are capable of predicting which patients are likely to be readmitted if discharged early.</description>

      <description>by: Sparkle Russell-Puleri
Problem Readmission whether planned or unplanned costs the U.S healthcare system billions of dollars annually. This, among other things, is of great importance to healthcare systems, since about one-third of readmissions are preventable, providing a huge opportunity for hospital systems to improve their quality of care 1. This compounded with the fact that hospitals are also penalized with up to 3% lower reimbursements from the Centers for Medicare &amp;amp; Medicaid Services(CMS) for increased readmission rates, as a part of the 2012 affordable care act passed by the Obama admistration 2, creates a huge oppotunity for the use of data to build algorithms that are capable of prediciting which patients are likely to be readmitted if discharged early.</description>

In the first part one of this tutorial we created a rough template of the Doctor AI: Predicting Clinical Events via Recurrent Neural Networks paper(2016) by Edward Choi et.al. In this tutorial we took it a step further using the Fast.ai buttom up approach. This code is fully functional and details on how the data was processed can be accessed in part one.

      <description>Background: Detailed review of Doctor AI: Predicting Clinical Events via Recurrent Neural Nets (Choi et.al 2016)
by: Sparkle Russell-Puleri and Dorian Puleri
Electronic medical records( EMRs), which is sometimes interchangeably called Electronic health records(EHRs) are primarily used to electronically-store patient health data digitally. While the use of these systems seem commonplace today, most notably due to the passing of the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act in 2014.</description>

In part one of this tutorial series, we demonstrated the matrix operations used to estimate the hidden states and outputs for the forward pass of a GRU. Based on our poor results, we obviously need to optimize our algorithm and test it on a test set to ensure generalizability. This is typically done using several steps/techniques. In this tutorial we will walkthrough what happens under the hood during optimization, specifically calculating the loss function and performing backpropagation through time to update the weights over several epochs.</description>

Often times we get consumed with using Deep learning frameworks that perform all of the required operations needed to build our models. However, there is some value to first understanding some of the basic matrix operations used under the hood. In this tutorial we will walk you through the simple matrix operations needed to understand how a GRU works.

      <description>By: Sparkle Russell-Puleri, Ph.D.
Background: According to the American Cancer Society, breast cancer is caused by the uncontrolled growth of breast cells, which leads to the formation of a tumor. These tumors can start from different at different locations in the breast. However, the vast majority of breast cancers begin in the ducts that carry milk to the nipple (ductal cancers). While, others can start in the glands that make breast milk (lobular cancers).</description>

      <description>By: Sparkle Russell-Puleri, Ph.D.
Project Goal: The objective of this project is to develop computational algorithm(Github code) that can accurately detect cardiovascular related diseases. The dataset used in this project was obtained from the publically available UCI repository heart disease dataset. This dataset has been considered the benchmark dataset in the computational cardiovascular space. The features used in the development of this model are considered medically relevant attributes(Age,sex,cp,rest bps,chol,fbs,restecg,thalach,exang,oldpeak,slope,ca,thal,class) as they significantly contribute to the progression of cardiovascular disease.</description>

      <title>Fluid shear stress induces upregulation of COX-2 and PGI release in endothelial cells via a pathway involving PECAM-1, PI3K, FAK, and p38.</title>

      <description>Determine the major mechanotransduction pathway by which blood flow-driven shear stress activates cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and prostaglandin I2 (PGI2) release in endothelial cells. Our work has demonstrated for the first time that COX-2/PGI2 mechanotransduction is mediated by the mechanosensor platelet endothelial cell adhesion mole- cule-1 (PECAM-1).

      <title>Hydraulic Conductivity of Smooth Muscle Cell-Initiated Arterial Cocultures.</title>
      <link>https://sparalic.github.io/publications/hydraulic-conductivity-of-smooth-muscle-cell-initiated-arterial-cocultures/</link>

      <guid>https://sparalic.github.io/publications/hydraulic-conductivity-of-smooth-muscle-cell-initiated-arterial-cocultures/</guid>
      <description>The purpose of the study was to examine the effects of arterial coculture conditions on the transport properties of several in vitro endothelial cell (EC)-smooth muscle cell (SMC)-porous filter constructs in which SMC were grown to confluence first and then EC were inoculated. This order of culturing simulates the environment of a blood vessel wall after endothelial layer damage due to stenting, vascular grafting or other vascular wall insult. For all coculture configurations examined, we observed that hydraulic conductivity (L(p)) values were significantly higher than predicted by a resistances-in-series (RIS) model accounting for the L(p) of EC and SMC measured separately.</description>

      <description>This study describes cocultures of arterial smooth muscle cells (SMCs) and endothelial cells (ECs) and the influences of their heterotypic interactions on hydraulic conductivity (L p ), an important transport property. A unique feature of these cocultures is that ECs were first grown to confluence and then SMCs were inoculated. Bovine aortic smooth muscle cells and bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAECs) were cocultured on Transwell Permeable Supports, and then exposed to a pressure-driven transmural flow.</description>

      <description>The molecular mass of the polysaccharide hyaluronan (HA) is an important determinant of its biological activity and physicochemical properties. One method currently used for the analysis of the molecular mass distribution of an HA sample is gel electrophoresis. In the current work, an improved agarose gel electrophoresis method for analysis of high molecular mass HA is presented and validated. HA mobility in 0.5% agarose minigels was found to be linearly related to the logarithm of molecular mass in the range from approximately 200 to 6000 kDa.</description>
